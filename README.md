# Problem Motivation

Shared micro-mobility operators provide services to the public by deploying scooters in a permitted area (service area). Users can unlock a scooter via mobile app, ride it and park it anywhere within the permitted area. Without intervention, scooters tend to move from high demand areas to low demand areas, which will be less accessible for the users. As an operator, we attempt to design a data-driven approach to optimize the supply of e-scooter in the service area, by moving scooters from low-demand zones to high-demand zones.

The problem setting is unnecessary identical to the actual operation scheme. We should simplify the problem, so the participants can easily understand the problem and come up with a solution to the problem.
